# Maintenance Butler

**Reclaim disk space by cleaning up old VS Code extension versions, cache files, and logs.**

VS Code accumulates gigabytes of stale data over time — outdated extension versions that were never removed, multiple layers of cache that rebuild automatically, and workspace storage for projects you deleted years ago. Maintenance Butler finds all of it, shows you the sizes, and lets you choose exactly what to clean.

> **Not yet on the Marketplace.** This extension is in active testing and has not been published yet.
> If you'd like to try it early, download the `.vsix` package from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/spectabile/maintenance-butler/releases) and install it manually:
> `Extensions` panel → `···` menu → **Install from VSIX…**

## Features

### Caches & Logs — auto-regenerated, safe to clean

Everything in this group is rebuilt automatically by VS Code. Deleting it is like clearing your browser cache — VS Code recreates it on next launch or on demand.

| Target | What it is | Default |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Compiled Bytecode (CachedData) | Pre-compiled V8 bytecode for VS Code's own JS files. Rebuilt on next launch. | ✅ On |
| Code Cache | Chromium's bytecode cache for renderer processes. Rebuilt automatically. | ✅ On |
| HTTP Cache | Cached network responses (Marketplace requests, update checks). | ✅ On |
| WebStorage | Asset cache for extension webview panels (JS, CSS, images). | ✅ On |
| GPU Caches | Compiled GPU shader and pipeline data (GPUCache, DawnGraphiteCache, DawnWebGPUCache, VideoDecodeStats). Rebuilt at startup. | ✅ On |
| Crash Dumps (Crashpad) | Diagnostic crash reports. No impact on app functionality. | ✅ On |
| Logs | VS Code and extension host log files. Fresh logs created on next launch. | ✅ On |
| Old Extension Versions | Version folders left behind after updates. Keeps only the newest version. | ✅ On |
| Obsolete Extensions (.obsolete) | Extension folders VS Code has already marked for removal. Processes pending removals immediately. | ✅ On |
| Cached Extension VSIXs | Downloaded `.vsix` packages for faster reinstallation. VS Code re-downloads if needed. | Off |
| Network Cache | Chromium network state data. Minor re-initialization on next launch. | Off |
| Service Worker Cache | Registered service workers for webview extensions. Re-registered automatically on next webview open. | Off |

### ⚠️ Your History — permanently deleted, cannot be recovered

> **Warning:** The items below are **not** auto-regenerated. Once deleted, they are gone forever. A confirmation dialog is always shown before cleaning anything in this group.

| Target | What it is | Default |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Orphaned Workspace Storage | Every workspace you open gets a storage folder containing open tabs, scroll positions, folded code sections, and extension state. This removes entries for project folders that **no longer exist on disk** — active workspaces are never touched. | Off |
| Local History / Timeline | VS Code's built-in per-file version history, visible in the Timeline panel. Lets you recover earlier versions of any file you've edited. Removes entries older than `historyMaxAgeDays` (default: 30 days). | Off |

**These can accumulate gigabytes over time** — especially on long-lived installations — but they represent real work history. Enable them only if you understand what will be deleted.

## Commands

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for:

- **Maintenance Butler: Clean…** — scan all installations, select what to clean, and run. Shows sizes for each item. Items from "Your History" display a permanent-deletion warning before proceeding.
- **Maintenance Butler: Show Disk Usage** — scan without deleting. Outputs a full report to the Output panel.
